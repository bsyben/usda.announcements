# usda.announcements

This is a simple package for retrieving USDA announcement days with the [USDA EMSI api](https://usda.library.cornell.edu/apidoc/index.html). You can obtain your own free api key from [here](https://www.ers.usda.gov/developer/data-apis/). 

To use this package, you need to decide the range of dates you want to use and the announcement publication id of your announcements.
